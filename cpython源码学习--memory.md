some annotation about anera . Anera is big memory block ,usually one or more pages(Actually, an Anera has 256KB ,which means 64pages). Allocate an entire memory will ensure addressable for any Byte. </font>


 * The allocator sub-allocates <Bigblocks of memory (called arenas) aligned
 * on a page boundary. This is a reserved virtual address space for the
 * current process (obtained through a malloc call). In no way this means
 * that the memory arenas will be used entirely. A malloc(<Big>) is usually
 * an address range reservation for <Bigbytes, unless all pages within this
 * space are referenced subsequently. So malloc'ing big blocks and not using
 * them does not mean "wasting memory". It's an addressable range wastage...
 *
 * Therefore, allocating arenas with malloc is not optimal, because there is
 * some address space wastage, but this is the most portable way to request
 * memory from the system across various platforms.

actully, there are two ways to implement this memory management.

1. like cpython, use realloc to get new location of memory. Uauslly, you can apply more then you need ,like double original or plus a const size bigger.
2. use linked list. Apply for new node of stuct , and insert new node in the list.Perhaps. this method is using in the situation which we needn`t sequence memory.

1. determine size for usedpools;
2. get pool form usedpools[size+size]
3. if pool != pool->nextpool, means still has pool for this size. we chech pool-freeblock, if it is not NULL ,return this block; if it is NULL, check whether nextoff<=maxoff(maybe some offset block have been free?),use its block;otherwise, pool is full,has no space for new obj,use pool->nextpool,but return NULL?
4. if pool == pool->nextpool, means has no pool for this size. we need to apply new pool for aernas
5. if usable_arenas == NULL; call new_arena(), get usable_arenas, then pool = usable_arenas->freepools
6. pool != NULL, check usbale_arenas->nfreepools == 0? if true to set usable_arenas = usable_arenas->nextarena; if false, do nothing;then, frontlink this pool in usedpoos[size + size]i; initialize this pool ,set  pool->szidx,pool->nextoffset\maxoffset,freeblock
7. pool == NULL, carve one pool from usable_arenas, as usable_arenas must have at least one pool, otherwise the arena could not be called as usable as the definition description.

there two situation:

1.nbytes < size(of origin block, which means shrinkage). if nbytes>75%size, we can tolerant this waste of memory, return origin pointor; else nbytes<75%size, apply new block bp with nbyte,memcpy(bp,p,nbytes)

free one obj,usually cause 5 situation:

1. aerna of the pool of the block may need free,if the nfreepools == ntotalpools;
2. aerna of the pool of the block may be avaliable , as the nfreepools ==1
3. the order of aerna in usbale_arenas may need modify ,as the nfreepools inc;
4. pool of the block is avaliable again, need to be inserted into usedpools, frontlink it to the size of userdpool; **this stragety mimics LRU**
5. nothing to do;
